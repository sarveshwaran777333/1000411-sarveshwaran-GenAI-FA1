AGRONOVA
Project Description:
AgroNova is a web-based Smart Farming Assistant developed using Python, Streamlit, and Google Gemini AI.
The application allows users to ask farming-related questions or upload plant images to receive short, simple, and practical advice.
The web app is designed for farmers and students, using easy English so that anyone can understand the answers.

Purpose of the Project

The purpose of AgroNova is to:
Support farmers with quick agricultural guidance
Use artificial intelligence to identify plant and leaf problems
Provide an easy-to-use web interface without technical complexity

Main Features:
1. Text-based Farming Questions:
       Users can type any question related to farming.
2. Image-based Plant Analysis:
       Users can upload images of leaves or plants to detect diseases or issues.
3. AI-generated Responses:
       Responses are generated using Google Gemini AI in simple language.
4. Single-Page Interface:
       All features are available on one page.
5. No Login Required:
       The app is accessible to all users without registration.

How the Web App Works:

1. The user opens the AgroNova web application.
2. The user either:
    types a farming question or speak the question to the AI or uploads an image related to farming.
3. The input is sent to the Gemini AI model.
4. The AI processes the input and returns a clear response.
5. The answer is displayed on the screen.

Technologies Used:
1. Streamlit – for building the web interface
2. Python – backend logic
3. Google Gemini AI – intelligent response generation
4. HTML/CSS (via Streamlit) – interface elements

Target Users:
1. Farmers
2. Agriculture students
3. Beginners in farming
4. Anyone seeking basic agricultural guidance

Limitations:
1. Requires an internet connection
2. Accuracy depends on image quality
3. Voice input is limited by browser support

Academic Declaration:
1. This web application was developed as part of an IB coursework project.
2. The work is original and created strictly for educational purposes.
